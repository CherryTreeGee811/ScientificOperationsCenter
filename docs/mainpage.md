# Project V: Advanced Software Development - Spacecraft
## Scientific Operations Centre Module

Welcome to the **Scientific Operations Centre** Module!
This module has been designed to implement the Payload Ops of the Scientific Operations Centre.

## General Overview

At a high level, the Scientific Operations Centre's purpose is two-fold.
First, the Scientific Operations Centre maintains a method of communication with the Ground Station.
Over this communication link, the Ground Station will transmit scientific experiment data to the Scientific Operations Centre.
Once this data is received the Scientific Operations Centre will store, analyze and display that data graphically in a web interface, available to any third party interested in the data.
